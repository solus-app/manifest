# Important
This repository will house the documents that are important to the development of this project, including the coding style, configs and etc.

# Structure
There is an organisation that will house the repositories, with different sizable components being different repositories that should contain the different products/applications.

We expect to have currently the following repositories:
* The React-Native front-end
* The GO Backend

An editor configuration for the backend is going to be provided alongside all other configuration files in this repository promptly.

The preferred IDEs for development are up to the developer's choice. Suggested IDEs are:
* VS Code
* Vim/Nvim
